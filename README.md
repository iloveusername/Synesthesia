# Synesthesia
 An Android App For Realtime Subtitles
 
 This application uses the Vosk library and Kaldi models for speech to text on Android.

 Deaf people make up 3.5% of the U.S. population, that's 11.5 million people. I'm making this app to reduce the need for sign language interpretors and to provide a method of understanding words that is easier than reading lips.

 This app was also made to be used with a 3D printed wearable HUD that uses your phone and a reflective piece of plastic to reduce costs. The end goal is a comfortable, wearable, and affordable HUD that provides live subtitles to those who need them. A link to the downloadable model will be available in the future.
